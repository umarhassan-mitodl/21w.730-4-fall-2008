Essays
------

You'll write and revise four essays in addition to several short non-revised homework assignments. Each student will also make one oral presentation. Readings will serve to get you thinking and provide models of good writing; they'll provide inspiration for your essays and discussion points for Essay 2. Here are the major writing assignments for the course.

Portfolios

At our last class meeting I'll collect a portfolio ({{% resource_link 7d8bb8d5-ac79-4d3a-0acc-59bc431dc79e "PDF" %}}) of all your written work for our class—so don't throw any of your drafts or homework away!

Oral Presentations
------------------

Oral presentations are a required part of all CI courses. In this class everyone will either give a 10-minute presentation on a food-related topic, or participate in a debate on the thesis of _In Defense of Food_.

Vocabulary Lists
----------------

I am asking you to keep a list of words that are new to you culled from our readings. You **may** include words that describe unfamiliar foods, kinds of hogs, etc.; but the most **useful** words to look up and learn are those that describe actions, moods, attitudes, characteristics of people-words you are likely to encounter again. Please follow the guidelines for the vocabulary list as described in this document ({{% resource_link 8778afa2-1226-2646-f18b-3ce0698e1844 "PDF" %}}).

Class Participation
-------------------

Please note that class discussions are part of the oral work of a communications-intensive class. All students are expected to participate in class discussions. Discussion should demonstrate not just familiarity with assigned readings, but also critical thought.
